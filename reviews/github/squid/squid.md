### Summary

Squid Caching Proxy Security Audit: 55 vulnerabilities and 35 0days

### Details

A brief review found an extremely large number of vulnerabilities in squid, and there is no proactive effort to fix them. "The Squid Team have been helpful and supportive during the process of reporting these issues. However, they are effectively understaffed, and simply do not have the resources to fix the discovered issues. Hammering them with demands to fix the issues wonâ€™t get far. ...  If you are running Squid in an environment which may suffer from any of these issues, then it is up to you to reassess whether Squid is the right solution for your system."

### Methodology

No methodology was provided.
